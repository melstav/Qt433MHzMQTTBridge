# Qt433MHzMQTTBridge

In the same vein as my Garage-Door project, I wanted to be able to monitor other doors for whether they're open or closed. Or more specifically, I wanted to monitor for open events.
For some doors, like refirgerator and freezer doors, it made sense to also monitor for close events and to be able to set a timer when certain doors are opened so that an automatic alert is triggered if they've been left open for too long.
